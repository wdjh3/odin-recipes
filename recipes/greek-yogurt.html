        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups nonfat or low-fat milk</li>
            <li>A quarter cup nonfat or low-fat plain yogurt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat milk in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until it is steaming, barely bubbling and registers 180 degrees Fahrenheit on a candy thermometer.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk in a clean, heat-safe container. Let stand, stirring frequently, until cooled to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine yogurt with half a cup of the 110 degrees Fahrenheit milk in  small bol, then stir the mixture back into the warm milk.</li>
            <li>Cover the container and wrap it in a clean kitchen towel to help keep it warm. Place in a very warm place and  let stand, undisturbed, until thickened and tangy, at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. Refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours. The yogurt will thicken a bit more in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Line a large fine-mesh sieve with 2 layers of cheesecloth and place over a large bowl. Spoon the cooled yogurt into the cheesecloth, then cover and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours, depending on how thick you want it.</li>
        </ol>
